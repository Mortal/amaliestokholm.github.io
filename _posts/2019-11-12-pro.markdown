Throughout my PhD I have been travelling a considerably amount more than I have done before and I have (more times than not) had travels that did not go according to the plan. I have been delayed or stranded in airports often and I have learned a thing or two about preparing myself for bad situation, optimizing a travel day, and in general learned how to make travelling more easy and more comfortable for my self.
