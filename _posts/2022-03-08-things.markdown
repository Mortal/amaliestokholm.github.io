The Internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/k1BneeJTDcU">Mountains of content, some better, some worse. If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first.</a>

Here is a ongoing list of nuggests that I like/love/recommend that everyone checks out.

## Inspiring things
- <a href="https://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2013/01/17/5266/">What I'm Not Going to Do</a>, Ann Finkbeiner:<br>
 For years, I have heard about the Finkbeiner test -- a simple test on how to write about scientists without redirecting the focus from their science to gender issues in the field. Just recently I discovered the origin of the Finkbeiner test. Highly recommend reading her opinions on the matter.

- <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/">The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life</a>, Radhika Nagpal:<br>
Honestly, this is one of most inspiring reads I have ever stumbled across. Professor Nagpal tells honestly about her approach to academia, co-parenting, and work/life balance.

## Things that make you laugh, then think
- <a href="https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us">J. K. Rowling</a> ContraPoints:<br>
This video essay does into depth with the J. K. Rowling recent controverses and how harmful it is to the trans-community. It is a polite, funny, in-depth work that explains a lot from the specific J. K. Rowling situation, but also more generally the trans-exclusionary radical feminist's point of view. For a ~~Potterhead like~~ me, this is one of the best descriptions of the important topic and it put into words some observations I also have had in feminists communitites and events.

A nice, fun compilation of the shortest papers ever published.
