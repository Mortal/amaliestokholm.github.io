					Hi! I'm Amalie and I am a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics.
					My primary scientific interest is <i>Galactic archaeology</i> where we learn about the history and evolution of our own galaxy - the Milky Way - by studying the demographics of its stars.


					I am current part of the <a href="asterochronometry.eu">Asterochronometry group</a> at <a href="unibo.it">Universit√† di Bologna</a> in Bologna, Italy.


					I did my PhD at the <a href="isimba.dk">iSIMBA group</a> at the <a href="https://sac.phys.au.dk">Stellar Astrophysics Centre</a> at <a href="https://au.dk">Aarhus University</a>, Denmark. I am also part of the developement team of <a href="github.com/BASTAcode/BASTA">BAyesian STellar Algorithm (BASTA)</a>, which is a flexible pipeline for the inference of stellar properties, such as the masses, radii, and ages of stars.

					When I am not studying stars, I really enjoy running, playing chess, geeking out over musicals, and puzzling around with minor coding projects.
					Currently, I am also working on the puzzle known as Cain's Jawbone, which is taking up most of my spare time. If you are also struggling with Kipling, Sherlock Holmes, and Henrys, feel free to write me.
